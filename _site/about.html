            Hi, my name is Rick and I love solving problems. 
            From crosswords through to DIY, 
            I love working out how to get from A to B and then implementing that solution. 
            After 7 years working in consumer products and business development 
            I decided to make the switch to programming as 
            it will allow me to make a career out of solving problems 
            and to one day make a positive impact on the world. 
            Please take a look around my website and get in touch to discuss anything 
            from coding through to video games, films, football...
