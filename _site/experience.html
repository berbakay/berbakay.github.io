            <h2>Dematic  - Software Engineer</h2>
             <a>Dec 2020 - Now</a>
            <p> With a focus on embedded systems for warehouses, I have honed my skills in C programming and Linux operations. 
                I have also gained experience in utilizing in-house testing frameworks 
                and following release protocols to ensure high-quality product delivery. My work focuses on specific processes
                within the warehouse and requires me to have detailed knowledge on these processes and how they interact with other
                areas of the warehouse.
                My role also includes regular customer interaction, 
                demonstrating my strong communication and organizational skills.
